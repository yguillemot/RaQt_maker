Some scripts to try to find out which methods have been validated and which have not.

One method is said validated when it has been used at least once in a test script or an example script.


This four scripts are called without arguments and have the file names they read or write hardcoded inside source.


mkMatrix.raku :
Try to finds which methods have been used and where.
This script is very imperfect and only see methods called directly.
    Read ../WhiteList.output
    Read all test and example scripts in ../../module
    Write matrix.txt


groups.raku :
Try to group methods with the same qualifiers and signature
    Read matrix.txt
    Write GroupsOfMethods.txt


qualifs.raku :
Try also to found which groups of qualifiers are used with the defined methods
    Read matrix.txt
    Write QualifiedMethods.txt


mkTestCoverageMatrix.raku
Try to found which methods have been tested (i.e. used) and where.
As the source of the Qt::QtWidgets module has been automatically generated, a method with the same qualifiers and signature as an other method may be considered as tested if this other method has been tested.
    Read ./methodsList.txt (a file written by the documentation generator)
    Write Sythesis.txt
    Write various other specific files grouping results about methods with
    the same qualifiers : signal.txt, virtual_protected.txt, etc... (see calls of
    the sub "work" at the end of the script)
